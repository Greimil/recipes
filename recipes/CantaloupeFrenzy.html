      A sweet, juicy slice of cantaloupe is refreshing any time of year. Like
      other melons, cantaloupe has a high water content (about 90 percent), but
      being packed with water doesn’t mean that this popular fruit lacks
      nutritional value.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, a cantaloupe is bursting with nutrients: It’s loaded with vitamin
      A (in the form of beta-carotene) as well as vitamin C, and is a good
      source of the mineral potassium. Another benefit is that the fruit’s
      deep-orange flesh is full of flavor, but is low in calories.
